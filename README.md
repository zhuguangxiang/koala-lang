## Install

```shell
git clone https://github.com/zhuguangxiang/koala-lang.git
cd koala-lang/
mkdir build
cd build/
cmake ..
make
```

For GNU/Linux, needs `cmake`, `gcc`, `flex/bison`, for example, in Ubuntu:

```shell
sudo apt install build-essential
sudo apt install flex
sudo apt install bison
sudo apt install cmake

// set environment variables
echo 'export PATH="~/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.profile
```

For Apple/MacOS, needs `cmake`, `XCode`, `flex/bison`, in MacOS, using
[`homebrew`](https://brew.sh/) to install dependencies softwares.

```shell
// XCode installed from `Apple` app store. It is too large, be patient!

brew install cmake
brew install flex
brew install bison

// set environment variables
echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/bison/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile
echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/flex/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile
echo 'export PATH="~/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile
```

The program `koala` is at `build/src/koala`, you can copy it to other places.

```shell
// `make install` will install `koala` into '~/.local/bin'
// so needs set `~/.local/bin` into environment variable `PATH`
make install
```
